# LOOPS

### 1) Using range(),  make a range from 45 to 210, using a for loop iterate over the sequence and print the elements. Skip the number 100 and break the loop at 205

### 2) Using a while loop and input, do the following :
- Ask the the user : "what is the product of 7 * 24 ?"
- check if the answer is right then exit the loop and print "You answered this Question correctly"
- if the answer is wrong, then print "Your Answer is wrong try again.." and show the user the question again.
